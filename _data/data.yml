    info:
      - role: Junior Data Scientist
        time: Mar 2023 - present
        company: Machine Learning Programs (MLP)
        details: |
            - Data drift detection : 
             Implemented techniques to detect and monitor data drift in production systems. 
             Developed statistical methods and automated processes to compare the data distributions identifying shifts that could impact model performance. 
             - Geographical enrichments for training pipeline: 
             Developed and implemented data preprocessing techniques to incorporate geographical features into the data used for training. 
             This involved geocoding, spatial data manipulation, and feature engineering.
             - Unit testing and coverage of in-house Python libraries:
              Wrote comprehensive unit tests and performed code coverage analysis 
              for critical Python libraries developed in-house. 
              This ensured the reliability and robustness of the libraries, 
              promoting code quality and reducing potential bugs or issues.
             - Feature importance analysis: 
             Utilized techniques such as permutation importance and SHAP values 
             to analyze the importance of features in machine learning models to provide valuable 
             insights into the underlying factors driving predictions

    title: Publications
    intro: 
      As a cosmologist, I have published up to 20 papers during my academic career. 
      My research has dealt with developing algorithms for the analysis of observational data to gain insights 
      into the composition and the evolution of the Universe. This endeavor has involved tools such as Python, Probabilistic Machine learning, Distributed Computing and Mathematical Modeling. 
      On many occasions I have been invited to discuss the outcome of my research in international conferences and workshops.
