    title: About Me
    summary: |
      As a researcher, I push myself daily at the edge of knowledge to solve problems by designing and performing simulated experiments, 
      analysing data and extracting final conclusions. I would like to apply my analytical and problem-solving mindset in helping companies
      in strategic analysis and in increasing the use of computational tools and new technologies
