    title: About Me
    summary: |
      As a scientist, I push myself daily at the edge of knowledge to solve problems by designing and performing simulated experiments, analysing data and extracting final conclusions. 
      I have a dream where AI will drive a new era of technological improvement for humanity leading us to overcome our limits and solve problems that seem unsolvable nowadays. I want to employ
      my skills in developing algorithms for data analysis and machine learning to contribute in shaping this future and see my dream realized.
